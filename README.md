# The_Arcade
This is a complete Arcade in which you can play games and listen to music.
This is purely made on python using pygame and we used other libraries like: tkinter, threading, mutagen, os, sys, random

To make sure The Arcade works, run the following command on your command prompt:
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
